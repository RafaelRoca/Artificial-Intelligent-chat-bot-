## Vasudev - Artificial Linguistic internet computer entity (Chatterbot)


Vasudev is created with the help of [AIML](http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html) programming language introduced by 
[Dr. Richard Wallace](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Richard_Wallace_(scientist)).

[A.L.I.C.E](https://www.alice.org/)  also referred to as Alicebot, or simply Alice, is a natural language processing chatterbotâ€”a program that engages in a conversation with a human by applying some heuristical pattern matching rules to the human's input, and in its online form it also relies on a hidden third person. It was inspired by Joseph Weizenbaum's classical ELIZA program. It is one of the strongest programs of its type and has won the Loebner Prize, awarded to accomplished humanoid, talking robots, three times (in 2000,[1] 2001,[1] and 2004). However, the program is unable to pass the Turing test, as even the casual user will often expose its mechanistic aspects in short conversations.
